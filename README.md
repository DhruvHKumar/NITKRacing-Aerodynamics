# NITKRacing-Aerodynamics

Hey guys! I am Dhruv Kumar and I am a part of NITKRacing. This is a repository containing all the tools and codes required to create an aerodynamic package and also contains Solidworks '17 models of our aerodynamic package designs. I hope it may give some inspiration for your own designs.

Please feel free to reach me on Instagram, LinkedIn or Gmail if you have any doubts regarding the design and also if you are interested I will upload the test results for the components

## Drag budget calculator
It is Power Budgeting tool, created on python to calculate the amount of power(in kW) which is available for adding on your aerodynamics components. Choose your components appropriatley, so that you do not exceed the power.
